# Uber Ride-Sharing Dashboard Analysis

**Repository Owner:** maryamyousry  
**Project:** Interactive Uber Operations Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI to analyze Uber ride-sharing operations, with a strong focus on booking performance, revenue generation, customer behavior, vehicle preferences, and cancellation patterns.

The dashboard provides actionable insights for operational efficiency, revenue optimization, and customer experience improvement in a ride-hailing business similar to Uber (including Auto-rickshaws, bikes, and various car categories).

## Dataset Description

The analysis is based on an Uber-style transactional dataset with the following key columns:

- **Date Time**: Timestamp of the ride booking
- **Booking ID**: Unique identifier for each ride request
- **Booking Status**: Final status of the booking (e.g., Completed, Cancelled, Lost/No Driver)
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each rider
- **Vehicle Type**: Category of vehicle requested (Auto, Bike, Go Mini, Go Sedan, Premier Sedan, eBike, Uber XL)
- **Pickup Location**: Starting point of the ride
- **Drop Location**: Destination of the ride
- **Cancelled Rides by Customer**: Historical count of cancellations by the customer
- **Reason for Cancelling by Customer**: Specific reason provided during customer-initiated cancellation

The dataset enables deep analysis of completion rates, cancellation drivers, customer loyalty, revenue distribution, and demand patterns.
